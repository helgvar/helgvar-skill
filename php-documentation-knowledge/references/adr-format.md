## PHP Project ADR Examples

### ADR-001: Use Doctrine ORM

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use Doctrine ORM for Persistence

## Status

Accepted

**Date:** 2025-03-15
**Deciders:** Tech Lead, Senior Developers

## Context

We need an ORM for our DDD project that supports:
- Repository pattern with domain interfaces
- Value Object mapping via Embeddables
- Identity Map for aggregate consistency
- Event-driven lifecycle hooks
- PHP 8.4 property promotion and readonly support

The project follows Clean Architecture where Domain layer has
no dependencies on infrastructure frameworks.

## Decision

We will use Doctrine ORM 3.x as our persistence layer because it:
- Supports Data Mapper pattern (entities are POPOs, no base class)
- Provides Embeddable for Value Object mapping
- Supports custom DBAL types for domain-specific types
- Has mature migration tooling (doctrine/migrations)
- Integrates with Symfony via doctrine-bundle

Repository interfaces are defined in the Domain layer.
Doctrine implementations reside in Infrastructure.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Entities remain POPO — no framework coupling in Domain
- Embeddables map Value Objects without serialization hacks
- Built-in Unit of Work and Identity Map ensure consistency
- XML/attribute mapping keeps entities clean

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers used to Active Record
- Lazy loading proxies require careful handling in DDD
- Aggregate boundary enforcement is manual (no built-in support)
- Performance tuning requires understanding of DQL and hydration

### Neutral
- Team needs to learn Doctrine-specific mapping configuration
- Migration workflow integrated into deployment pipeline

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative A: Cycle ORM
- **Pros:** Modern PHP, annotation-free, good performance
- **Cons:** Smaller ecosystem, fewer learning resources
- **Rejected because:** Less mature Symfony integration, smaller community

### Alternative B: Raw PDO + Custom Mapper
- **Pros:** Full control, no ORM overhead, simple queries
- **Cons:** Manual mapping, no identity map, no migrations
- **Rejected because:** Too much boilerplate for complex domain model
```

### ADR-002: Use RabbitMQ for Messaging

```markdown
# ADR-002: Use RabbitMQ for Asynchronous Messaging

## Status

Accepted

**Date:** 2025-03-20
**Deciders:** Tech Lead, Platform Engineer

## Context

The system needs asynchronous event processing for:
- Domain event propagation between bounded contexts
- Read model projection updates (CQRS)
- Email/notification delivery
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

Requirements:
- At-least-once delivery guarantees
- Dead letter queue support
- Message routing (topic-based)
- PHP 8.4 integration via Symfony Messenger

## Decision

We will use RabbitMQ 3.13 with AMQP protocol because it:
- Provides reliable message delivery with acknowledgments
- Supports dead letter exchanges for failed message handling
- Offers flexible routing via exchanges (direct, topic, fanout)
- Integrates with Symfony Messenger via messenger transport

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reliable event delivery between bounded contexts
- Dead letter queues catch and preserve failed messages
- Topic exchanges enable flexible event routing
- Native support in Symfony Messenger transport

### Negative
- Additional infrastructure component to maintain
- Message ordering is per-queue only (not global)
- Requires monitoring (queue depth, consumer lag)
- Serialization format must be standardized across contexts

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative A: Apache Kafka
- **Pros:** Event log, replay, high throughput, global ordering per partition
- **Cons:** Heavier infrastructure, PHP client less mature
- **Rejected because:** Overkill for current scale; RabbitMQ simpler to operate

### Alternative B: Redis Streams
- **Pros:** Already using Redis, simple setup, consumer groups
- **Cons:** No dead letter support, less durable, limited routing
- **Rejected because:** Insufficient delivery guarantees for domain events
```

### ADR-003: Use JWT for API Authentication

```markdown
# ADR-003: Use JWT for API Authentication

## Status

Accepted

**Date:** 2025-04-01
**Deciders:** Tech Lead, Security Engineer

## Context

The REST API needs stateless authentication for:
- Horizontal scaling (no shared session state)
- Microservice-to-microservice communication
- Mobile and SPA client support
- Token-based authorization with claims

## Decision

We will use JWT (RS256) with short-lived access tokens (15 min)
and long-lived refresh tokens (30 days) stored in HTTP-only cookies.

Implementation: lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle with Symfony Security.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Stateless authentication enables horizontal scaling
- RS256 allows token verification without shared secret
- Claims carry authorization data (roles, context permissions)
- Refresh tokens enable session extension without re-login

### Negative
- Tokens cannot be revoked before expiry (mitigated by short TTL)
- Token size larger than session ID
- Requires secure key management (RSA key pair)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative A: Session-based (Redis)
- **Pros:** Simple revocation, small cookie
- **Cons:** Shared state, Redis dependency for auth
- **Rejected because:** Adds statefulness, complicates scaling

### Alternative B: OAuth2 + Opaque Tokens
- **Pros:** Standard protocol, revocable tokens
- **Cons:** Requires token introspection endpoint, added latency
- **Rejected because:** Added complexity for internal API
